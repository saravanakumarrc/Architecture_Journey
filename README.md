# üèóÔ∏è Architecture Journey: Bridge from Software Engineer to Architect

Welcome to the Architecture Journey repository! This is a comprehensive guide designed to help software engineers transition into architecture roles. Unlike other resources that focus on individual topics, this repository provides a structured, interconnected learning path with detailed documentation, examples, mind maps, and most importantly - a complete skills checklist that connects all the concepts together.

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

The transition from Software Engineer to Architect is often challenging because:
- No single source of truth exists for this career transition
- Most resources focus on individual topics without showing their interconnections
- Engineers get lost jumping between different concepts
- Existing roadmaps lack depth and practical implementation guidance
