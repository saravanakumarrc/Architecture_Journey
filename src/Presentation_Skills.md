## Presentation Framework

### 1. Structure Flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Presentation Flow"
        H[Hook/Opening] --> C[Context]
        C --> P[Problem Statement]
        P --> S[Solution]
        S --> D[Demo/Examples]
        D --> N[Next Steps]
        
        subgraph "Supporting Elements"
            V[Visual Aids]
            Q[Q&A Preparation]
            B[Backup Slides]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Audience Engagement
