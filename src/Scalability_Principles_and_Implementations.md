## Architectural Components

### 1. Load Distribution

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Load Balancing Strategy"
        LB[Load Balancer] --> S1[Server 1]
        LB --> S2[Server 2]
        LB --> S3[Server 3]
        
        subgraph "Health Checks"
            H1[Health Monitor]
            H2[Circuit Breaker]
            H3[Failover Logic]
        end
        
        H1 --> S1
        H1 --> S2
        H1 --> S3
    end
```

### 2. Data Management

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Architecture"
        direction TB
        
        C[Client] --> LB[Load Balancer]
        LB --> A1[App Server 1]
        LB --> A2[App Server 2]
        
        subgraph "Data Layer"
            A1 --> Cache[Cache Layer]
            A2 --> Cache
            Cache --> DB1[(Primary DB)]
            Cache --> DB2[(Read Replica 1)]
            Cache --> DB3[(Read Replica 2)]
        end
    end
```

## Scalability Assessment Matrix

| Aspect | Metrics | Scale Triggers | Monitoring |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| CPU | Usage % | >70% | Real-time |
| Memory | Available MB | <20% | Real-time |
| Storage | Used Space | >80% | Daily |
| Network | Bandwidth | >85% | Real-time |
| Requests | RPS | >1000/s | Real-time |
| Response | Latency | >200ms | Real-time |

Remember: Scalability is not just about handling more loadâ€”it's about doing so efficiently while maintaining system reliability and performance. Always consider the trade-offs between different scaling approaches and choose the one that best fits your specific needs.
