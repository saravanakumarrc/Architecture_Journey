  resource_group_name   = "production-rg"
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
  vm_size              = "Standard_DS1_v2"

  storage_os_disk {
    name              = "osdisk"
    caching           = "ReadWrite"
    create_option     = "FromImage"
    managed_disk_type = "Premium_LRS"
  }
}
```

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

### Characteristics

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "PaaS Architecture"
        direction TB
        
        App[Application] --> P[PaaS Platform]
        P --> S1[Auto-scaling]
        P --> S2[Load Balancing]
        P --> S3[Database]
        P --> S4[Monitoring]
    end
```

### Use Cases
1. Web applications
2. API backends
3. IoT applications
4. Data analytics

### Implementation Example
```yaml
# Azure App Service Configuration
resource "azurerm_app_service" "example" {
  name                = "webapp-example"
  location            = "eastus"
  resource_group_name = "production-rg"
  app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id

  site_config {
    dotnet_framework_version = "v6.0"
    always_on               = true
  }

  app_settings = {
    "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE" = "1"
  }
}
```

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

### Characteristics
- Fully managed applications
- Subscription-based pricing
- Automatic updates
- Multi-tenant architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "SaaS Multi-tenancy"
        direction TB
        
        subgraph "Application Layer"
            A1[Tenant 1]
            A2[Tenant 2]
            A3[Tenant 3]
        end
        
        subgraph "Data Layer"
            D1[(Database 1)]
            D2[(Database 2)]
            D3[(Database 3)]
        end
        
        A1 --> D1
        A2 --> D2
        A3 --> D3
    end
```

    participant F as Function
    participant S as Storage
    
    C->>G: HTTP Request
    G->>F: Trigger Function
    F->>S: Process Data
    S-->>F: Data Response
    F-->>G: Function Response
    G-->>C: HTTP Response
```

### Implementation Example
```typescript
// Azure Function
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name);
    
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name
        : "Please pass a name";

    context.res = {
        status: 200,
        body: responseMessage
    };
}
```

## Cloud Deployment Models

### 1. Public Cloud
- Shared infrastructure
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Quick scalability
- Managed services

### 2. Private Cloud
- Dedicated infrastructure
- Enhanced security
- Compliance control
- Customizable environment

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

graph LR
    subgraph "Hybrid Architecture"
        direction LR
        
        subgraph "Private Cloud"
            P1[Critical Apps]
            P2[Sensitive Data]
        end
        
        subgraph "Public Cloud"
            C1[Web Apps]
            C2[Dev/Test]
        end
        
        P1 <-->|Secure Connection| C1
        P2 <-->|Data Sync| C2
    end
```

### 4. Multi-Cloud
- Multiple providers
- Vendor flexibility
- Geographic distribution
- Risk mitigation

## Architecture Decision Framework

Consider these factors when choosing a cloud model:

1. **Control Requirements**
   - Infrastructure control needs
   - Custom configuration requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Compliance needs

2. **Operational Factors**
   - Team expertise
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Deployment frequency
   - Scaling requirements

3. **Cost Considerations**
   - Capital vs operational expenses
   - Resource utilization
   - Management costs
   - Scaling costs

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Performance needs
   - Integration requirements
   - Data residency
   - Security compliance

Remember: Choose the cloud model that best fits your specific requirements while considering the trade-offs between control, responsibility, and management overhead.
