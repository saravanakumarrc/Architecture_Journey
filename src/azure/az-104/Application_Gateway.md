# Azure Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer and application delivery controller (ADC) that operates at Layer 7 (application layer) of the OSI model. It provides advanced request routing, SSL termination, web application firewall (WAF), and URL-based content routing capabilities for your web applications.

## Comparison with Traffic Manager

| Feature | Application Gateway | Traffic Manager |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Layer | Layer 7 (Application) | DNS (Global) |
| Scope | Regional | Global |
| Protocol Support | HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP/2 | Any TCP/IP protocol |
| Routing Methods | URL-based, Path-based | Performance, Weighted, Priority, Geographic |
| Health Probes | HTTP/HTTPS | HTTP/HTTPS/TCP |
| SSL Termination | Yes | No |
| WAF Capabilities | Yes | No |
| Session Affinity | Yes | No |

## Common Use Cases

1. **Web Application Hosting**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Users] --> B[Application Gateway]
    B --> C[Web Farm 1]
    B --> D[Web Farm 2]
    B --> E[Web Farm 3]
```

2. **Microservices Architecture**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Application Gateway] --> B[Service 1]
    A --> C[Service 2]
    A --> D[Service 3]
    
    B --> E[Container Apps]
    C --> F[Azure Functions]
    D --> G[Virtual Machines]
```

## Security Features

### WAF Capabilities
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[WAF] --> B[OWASP Rules]
    A --> C[Custom Rules]
    A --> D[Rate Limiting]
    
    B --> B1[SQL Injection]
    B --> B2[XSS Protection]
    B --> B3[Command Injection]
    
    C --> C1[IP Restrictions]
    C --> C2[Geo-filtering]
    
    D --> D1[DDoS Protection]
    D --> D2[Bot Protection]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable auto-scaling
   - Configure appropriate instance count
   - Use appropriate tier (Standard/WAF)
   - Monitor backend health

2. **Security Configuration**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       A[Security] --> B[SSL Policy]
       A --> C[WAF Rules]
       A --> D[Network Security]
       
       B --> E[TLS Version]
       C --> F[Rule Sets]
       D --> G[NSG Config]
   ```

3. **High Availability**
   - Deploy across availability zones
   - Configure multiple backend instances
   - Implement health monitoring
   - Use backup pools

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Metrics to Monitor
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Monitoring] --> B[Performance]
    A --> C[Health]
    A --> D[Security]
    
    B --> B1[Throughput]
    B --> B2[Response Time]
    B --> B3[Failed Requests]
    
    C --> C1[Backend Health]
    C --> C2[Capacity Units]
    
    D --> D1[WAF Logs]
    D --> D2[Access Logs]
```

## Integration Patterns

1. **Multi-site Hosting**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Application Gateway] --> B[Site 1]
    A --> C[Site 2]
    A --> D[Site 3]
    
    B --> E[Backend Pool 1]
    C --> F[Backend Pool 2]
    D --> G[Backend Pool 3]
```

2. **API Management**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Users] --> B[Application Gateway]
    B --> C[API Management]
    C --> D[Backend APIs]
```
