## Core Components

### 1. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Application
    participant I as Identity Provider
    participant R as Resource
    
    U->>A: Access Request
    A->>I: Auth Request
    I->>U: Login Form
    U->>I: Credentials
    I->>A: Token/Session
    A->>R: Authorized Request
    R->>A: Resource
    A->>U: Response
```

### 2. Authorization Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Authorization Framework"
        U[User] --> R[Role]
        R --> P[Permission]
        P --> RS[Resource]
        
        subgraph "Policy Engine"
            PE[Policy]
            RE[Rules]
            AE[Attributes]
        end
    end
```

## Trade-offs

### Security vs. Usability
- **High Security**
  - Pros:
    * Better protection
    * Reduced risk
    * Compliance adherence
  - Cons:
    * User friction
    * More complexity
    * Higher support needs

### Centralized vs. Decentralized
- **Centralized Auth**
  - Pros:
    * Easier management
    * Consistent policy
    * Better control
  - Cons:
    * Single point of failure
    * Higher impact on issues
    * Potential bottleneck

### Session vs. Token
- **Token-based**
  - Pros:
    * Stateless
    * Better scalability
    * More flexibility
  - Cons:
    * Token size
    * Revocation challenges
    * More complexity

### Custom vs. Standard
- **Standard Solutions**
  - Pros:
    * Proven security
    * Better interoperability
    * More documentation
  - Cons:
    * Less flexibility
    * Feature limitations
    * Dependency risks

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Use MFA
   - Strong password policy
   - Secure session management
   - Rate limiting
   - Account recovery
   - Audit logging
   - Regular reviews

2. **Authorization**
   - Least privilege
   - Role-based access
   - Regular audits
   - Policy documentation
   - Access reviews
   - Monitor changes
   - Test policies

3. **Security**
   - TLS everywhere
   - Secure storage
   - Token protection
   - Key management
   - Regular updates
   - Security testing
   - Compliance checks

4. **Operations**
   - Monitor access
   - Alert on issues
   - Log security events
   - Regular backups
   - DR testing
   - Team training
   - Documentation

## Security Controls Matrix

| Control | Implementation | Monitoring | Review Frequency |
|---------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Authentication | MFA + Password | Real-time | Daily |
| Authorization | RBAC + ABAC | Real-time | Weekly |
| Session | Token + Timeout | Real-time | Daily |
| Access Control | Policy-based | Real-time | Weekly |
| Encryption | TLS 1.3 + AES | Daily | Monthly |
| Audit | Full logging | Real-time | Weekly |

## Common Attack Vectors

1. **Authentication Attacks**
   - Brute force
   - Credential stuffing
   - Password spraying
   - Session hijacking
   - Token theft

2. **Authorization Attacks**
   - Privilege escalation
   - Insecure direct object references
   - Missing function level access control
   - Unauthorized API access

3. **Infrastructure Attacks**
   - Man-in-the-middle
   - SSL stripping
   - DNS hijacking
   - DDoS

4. **Application Attacks**
   - XSS
   - CSRF
   - Injection
   - Parameter tampering

Remember: Security is a continuous process. Regularly review and update your authentication and authorization frameworks to address new threats and maintain strong security posture.
