## Model Development Patterns

### 1. Feature Engineering Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Feature Engineering"
        R[Raw Data] --> C[Cleansing]
        C --> T[Transform]
        T --> V[Validate]
        V --> S[(Feature Store)]
        
        subgraph "Operations"
            N[Normalization]
            E[Encoding]
            I[Imputation]
            A[Aggregation]
        end
    end
```

#### Feature Store Architecture
1. **Online Store**
   - Low latency access
   - Real-time features
   - Cache layer
   - Version control

2. **Offline Store**
   - Historical features
   - Batch processing
   - Data consistency
   - Point-in-time joins

### 2. Training Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Training Flow"
        D[Data] --> P[Preprocessing]
        P --> T[Training]
        T --> E[Evaluation]
        E --> R[Registry]
        
        subgraph "Components"
            VC[Version Control]
            HP[Hyperparameters]
            MT[Metrics]
        end
    end
```

#### Pipeline Components
| Component | Purpose | Artifacts | Monitoring |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Data | Source Management | Raw Data | Quality Metrics |
| Preprocessing | Feature Creation | Features | Data Stats |
| Training | Model Building | Model Files | Loss Curves |
| Evaluation | Performance Check | Metrics | KPIs |

## Model Serving Patterns

### 1. Real-Time Inference

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API Gateway
    participant L as Load Balancer
    participant M as Model Server
    participant R as Model Registry
    
    C->>A: Request Prediction
    A->>L: Route Request
    L->>M: Forward Request
    M->>R: Get Model Version
    R-->>M: Return Model
    M-->>A: Prediction Result
    A-->>C: Response
```

#### Serving Components
1. **Model Server**
   - Model loading
   - Inference engine
   - Resource management
   - Request handling

2. **Request Pipeline**
   - Input validation
   - Pre-processing
   - Prediction
   - Post-processing

### 2. Batch Inference

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Batch Processing"
        I[(Input Data)] --> B[Batch Processor]
        B --> M[Model Server]
        M --> O[(Output Store)]
        
        subgraph "Features"
            P[Parallelization]
            C[Checkpointing]
            R[Recovery]
        end
    end
```

#### Processing Modes
| Mode | Latency | Throughput | Use Case |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Real-time | Low | Low | Interactive |
| Near Real-time | Medium | Medium | Streaming |
| Batch | High | High | Bulk Processing |

## Model Management

### 1. Model Registry

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Registry Architecture"
        V[Version Control] --> M[Metadata Store]
        M --> A[Artifact Store]
        A --> D[Deployment]
        
        subgraph "Features"
            VM[Version Management]
            MM[Metadata Management]
            AM[Artifact Management]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Model Lifecycle
1. **Development**
   - Experimentation
   - Training
   - Validation
   - Documentation

2. **Deployment**
   - Registry storage
   - Environment setup
   - Rollout strategy
   - Monitoring setup

3. **Monitoring**
   - Performance tracking
   - Drift detection
   - Resource usage
   - Error tracking

## Monitoring Framework

### 1. Model Metrics

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monitoring System"
        P[Performance] --> D[Drift]
        D --> R[Resources]
        R --> A[Alerts]
        
        subgraph "Metrics"
            ACC[Accuracy]
            LAT[Latency]
            THR[Throughput]
            CPU[Resource Usage]
        end
    end
