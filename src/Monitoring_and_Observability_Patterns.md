## Observability Components

### 1. Three Pillars

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Observability Pillars"
        M[Metrics] --> A[Analysis]
        L[Logs] --> A
        T[Traces] --> A
        A --> I[Insights]
        
        subgraph "Data Processing"
            C[Collect]
            P[Process]
            S[Store]
            V[Visualize]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Telemetry Pipeline"
        S[Sources] --> C[Collectors]
        C --> P[Processors]
        P --> ST[Storage]
        ST --> V[Visualization]
        
        subgraph "Processing"
            F[Filter]
            E[Enrich]
            A[Aggregate]
            R[Route]
        end
    end
```

  - Pros:
    * Immediate insights
    * Faster responses
    * Better alerting
  - Cons:
    * Higher resource usage
    * More complex
    * Increased cost

### Sampling vs. Full Collection
- **Full Collection**
  - Pros:
    * Complete data
    * No missing events
    * Better analysis
  - Cons:
    * Higher costs
    * More storage
    * Processing overhead

### Retention vs. Cost
- **Long Retention**
  - Pros:
    * Historical analysis
    * Trend detection
    * Compliance
  - Cons:
    * Higher storage costs

## Metrics Framework

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Metrics Hierarchy"
        B[Business] --> S[Service]
        S --> I[Infrastructure]
        
        subgraph "Categories"
            U[Usage]
            P[Performance]
            R[Reliability]
            H[Health]
        end
    end
```

## Performance Indicators Matrix

| Category | Metric | Warning | Critical | Collection |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| Infrastructure | CPU Usage | 70% | 85% | Real-time |
| Application | Error Rate | 0.1% | 1% | Real-time |
| Business | Transaction Rate | -10% | -20% | Hourly |
| User Experience | Latency | 200ms | 500ms | Real-time |
| Security | Auth Failures | 5/min | 20/min | Real-time |
| Availability | Uptime | 99.9% | 99% | Daily |

Remember: A good observability strategy provides insights across all layers of your system. Focus on collecting meaningful data that helps understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.
