## Governance Patterns

### 1. Federated Governance
- Central architecture team sets standards
- Domain teams have autonomy within boundaries
- Regular alignment meetings
- Distributed decision making with oversight

### 2. Centralized Governance
- Single architecture authority
- Standardized processes
- Consistent enforcement
- Central decision making

### 3. Hybrid Governance
- Mix of central and distributed control
- Policy-based boundaries
- Local autonomy for specific domains
- Shared decision making framework

## Maturity Model

graph TB
    subgraph "Governance Maturity Levels"
        L1[Level 1: Ad Hoc] --> L2[Level 2: Repeatable]
        L2 --> L3[Level 3: Defined]
        L3 --> L4[Level 4: Managed]
        L4 --> L5[Level 5: Optimizing]
        
        subgraph "Key Characteristics"
            P[Processes]

            M[Metrics]
            C[Culture]
        end
    end

## Core Governance Components

### 1. Architecture Review Board (ARB)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ARB Process Flow"
        P[Proposal] --> R[Review]
        R --> D[Decision]
        D --> |Approved| I[Implementation]
        D --> |Rejected| F[Feedback]
        F --> P
        
        subgraph "Review Criteria"
            T[Technical Fit]
            B[Business Alignment]
            S[Security/Risk]
            C[Cost/Benefit]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Architecture Standards Management

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Standards Management"
        S[Standards] --> V[Version Control]
        S --> R[Review Process]
        S --> D[Distribution]
        
        subgraph "Categories"
            T[Technical]
            B[Business]
            SC[Security]
            O[Operations]
        end
    end
```

### 3. Change Management Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Change Management"
        RFC[Request for Change] --> IA[Impact Analysis]
        IA --> RV[Review]
        RV --> |Approved| SC[Schedule Change]
        RV --> |Rejected| FB[Feedback]
        SC --> IM[Implementation]
        IM --> PO[Post Implementation]
    end
```

## Governance Implementation

### 1. Decision Making Framework

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Decision Framework"
        P[Problem] --> A[Analysis]
        A --> O[Options]
        O --> E[Evaluation]
        E --> D[Decision]
        D --> I[Implementation]
        
        subgraph "Evaluation Criteria"
            B[Business Value]
            T[Technical Fit]
            R[Risk]
            C[Cost]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Compliance Monitoring

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Compliance Monitoring"
        direction TB
        
        A[Automated Checks] --> R[Results]
        M[Manual Reviews] --> R
        R --> D[Dashboard]
        
        subgraph "Actions"
            D --> N[Notifications]
            D --> E[Escalations]
            D --> F[Fixes]
        end
    end
```

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Governance KPIs
| Metric | Description | Target | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Architecture Compliance | % of projects following standards | >95% | Monthly |
| Review Cycle Time | Days to complete review | <5 days | Per Review |
| Technical Debt | Ratio of debt to new features | <20% | Quarterly |
| Standards Adoption | % teams using standards | >90% | Monthly |

### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix
| Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level | Required Actions |
|--------|------------|------------|------------------|
| High | High | Critical | Immediate ARB Review |
| High | Low | High | Standard Review |
| Low | High | Medium | Team Review |
| Low | Low | Low | Self Assessment |
