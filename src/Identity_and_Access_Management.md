# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Overview
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the right users have appropriate access to technology resources. This document outlines the principles, components, and implementation strategies for enterprise IAM.

## Core Components

### 1. Identity Management
- User lifecycle management
- Directory services
- Identity providers
- Federation services
- Self-service capabilities

### 2. Access Management
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization frameworks
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Just-in-time access

### 3. Governance
- Policy management
- Access reviews
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit logging
- Risk assessment

## Design Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Least privilege access
- Network segmentation
- Identity-based security
- Continuous verification

### 2. Security by Design
- Defense in depth
- Multi-factor authentication
- Encryption standards
- Session management
- Security monitoring

### 3. User Experience
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Self-service capabilities
- Password policies
- MFA options
- User lifecycle management

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Identity Infrastructure
- Directory services
- Federation services
- Authentication protocols
- Password management
- Identity synchronization

### 2. Access Control
- Role management
- Permission mapping
- Access policies
- Approval workflows
- Emergency access

### 3. Monitoring and Compliance
- Activity monitoring
- Compliance reporting
- Threat detection
- Incident response
- Audit logging

## Best Practices

### 1. Identity Management
- Centralized identity store
- Automated provisioning
- Regular access reviews
- Strong authentication
- Identity lifecycle management

### 2. Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access
- Just-in-time access
- Separation of duties
- Regular recertification

### 3. Security
- Multi-factor authentication
- Privileged access management
- Session management
- Password policies
- Security monitoring

### 4. Compliance
- Regulatory compliance
- Audit capabilities
- Policy enforcement
- Documentation
- Regular reviews

## Implementation Steps

1. Assessment Phase
   - Current state analysis
   - Requirements gathering
   - Gap analysis
   - Strategy development
   - Planning

2. Foundation Setup
