            [Identity Providers]
            [Multi-factor Auth]
            [SSO]

## Defense in Depth

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Security Layers"
        direction TB
        
        P[Perimeter Security] --> N[Network Security]
        N --> H[Host Security]
        H --> A[Application Security]
        A --> D[Data Security]
        
        subgraph "Controls"
            C1[Prevention]
            C2[Detection]
            C3[Response]
        end
    end
```

## Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Application
    participant I as Identity Provider
    participant R as Resource
    
    U->>A: Access Request
    A->>I: Authentication Request
    I->>U: Credential Challenge
    U->>I: Provide Credentials
    I->>A: Token/Session
    A->>R: Authorized Request
    R->>A: Resource Response
    A->>U: Resource
```

## Zero Trust Architecture

    subgraph "Zero Trust Model"
        direction TB
        
        U[User/Device] --> A{Authentication}
        A --> V{Verification}
        V --> P{Policy Check}
        P --> R[Resource Access]
        
        subgraph "Continuous Validation"
            M[Monitor]
            L[Log]
            E[Evaluate]
        end
    end
```

## Trade-offs

### Security Level vs. User Experience
- **High Security**
  - Pros:
    * Better protection
    * Reduced risk
    * Compliance adherence
  - Cons:
    * User friction
    * Slower access
    * Higher complexity

### Centralized vs. Distributed Security
- **Centralized Security**
  - Pros:
    * Easier management
    * Consistent policies
    * Better visibility
  - Cons:
    * Single point of failure
    * Performance bottleneck
    * Higher impact on failure

### Prevention vs. Detection
- **Prevention Focus**
  - Pros:
    * Proactive protection
    * Reduced incidents
    * Lower risk
  - Cons:
    * Higher costs
    * More restrictions
    * Potential false positives

### Automation vs. Manual Control
- **Automated Security**
  - Pros:
    * Faster response
    * Consistent enforcement
    * 24/7 protection
  - Cons:
    * Complex setup
    * Potential false positives
    * Higher initial cost

## Security Maturity Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Security Maturity"
        L1[Basic] --> L2[Managed]
        L2 --> L3[Defined]
        L3 --> L4[Measured]
        L4 --> L5[Optimized]
        
        subgraph "Key Areas"
            P[Policies]
            C[Controls]
            M[Monitoring]
            R[Response]
        end
    end
```

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Implement MFA everywhere
   - Use secure session management
   - Enforce password policies
   - Regular access reviews
   - Monitor auth attempts
   - Enable account recovery
   - Audit authentication logs

2. **Authorization**
   - Follow least privilege
   - Regular permission reviews
   - Monitor access patterns
   - Implement separation of duties
   - Document access policies
   - Automate access controls
   - Regular compliance checks

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Secure key management
   - Regular key rotation
   - Implement backup security
   - Monitor data access
   - Enable data masking
   - Regular security audits

4. **Network Security**
   - Segment networks
   - Monitor traffic
   - Regular security scans
   - Update security rules
   - Monitor endpoints
   - Implement zero trust
   - Regular penetration testing

## Security Controls Matrix

| Domain | Control Type | Implementation | Monitoring |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Authentication | Preventive | MFA, Password Policy | Auth Logs |
| Authorization | Detective | RBAC, ABAC | Access Logs |
| Data Security | Preventive | Encryption, DLP | Data Access Logs |
| Network | Preventive/Detective | Firewalls, IDS/IPS | Traffic Logs |
| Application | Preventive | Input Validation, CSRF | App Logs |
| Physical | Preventive | Access Cards, Cameras | Security Logs |

Remember: Security is a continuous process, not a one-time implementation. Regular reviews, updates, and monitoring are essential components of a robust security architecture.
