# Time Series Databases

## Overview
Time Series Databases (TSDBs) are optimized for handling time-series data: sequences of data points indexed by time.

    A[Time Series Data] --> B[Metrics]
    A --> C[Events]
    A --> D[Telemetry]
    B --> E[System Metrics]
    B --> F[Business Metrics]
    C --> G[Log Events]
    C --> H[User Actions]
    D --> I[IoT Sensors]
    D --> J[Application Traces]
```

## Key Characteristics
- Optimized for time-based queries
- High write throughput
- Efficient data compression
- Automatic data retention policies
- Built-in aggregation functions

## Common Use Cases
1. Infrastructure Monitoring
2. IoT Data Collection
3. Financial Market Data
4. Application Performance Monitoring
5. Weather Data Analysis

    (Advantages)
      [Optimized for time-based queries]
      [Efficient data compression]
      [High write throughput]
      [Built-in aggregation]
    (Disadvantages)
      [Limited ad-hoc queries]
      [Complex replication]

      [Learning curve]
```

### When to Use
- High-frequency time-stamped data
- Need for time-based analytics
- Requirement for data retention policies
- Performance-critical time-series operations

### When Not to Use
- Complex relationships between entities
- Need for ACID transactions
- Random access patterns
- Frequent updates to historical data

## Tools and Ecosystem

### Visualization
- Grafana
- Chronograf
- Kibana

### Integration
- Telegraf
- Prometheus Exporters
- Beats

### Management
- Kapacitor (alerting)
- Continuous Queries
- Retention Policies

## Performance Considerations
1. Write Performance
   - Batch writes
   - Proper timestamp indexing
   - Efficient tag cardinality

2. Query Performance
   - Use of materialized views
   - Proper time-bucket selection
   - Index optimization

3. Storage Optimization
   - Compression algorithms
   - Data downsampling
   - Retention policies

## Security Best Practices
1. Authentication
   - Enable authentication
   - Use TLS/SSL
   - Implement role-based access

2. Network Security
   - Configure firewalls
   - Use VPCs/private networks
   - Implement IP whitelisting

3. Data Protection
   - Regular backups
   - Encryption at rest
   - Audit logging

## Sample Implementation

### Basic Data Model
```sql
// Example InfluxDB data model
measurement,tag_set field_set timestamp
cpu,host=server01,region=us-west usage_idle=98.2,usage_user=1.8 1434067467000000000
```

### Common Queries
```sql
// Example InfluxDB queries
-- Get average CPU usage by host for last hour
SELECT mean("usage_user") 
FROM "cpu" 
WHERE time > now() - 1h 
GROUP BY host, time(5m)

-- Find highest memory usage spikes
SELECT max("used_percent") 
FROM "mem" 
WHERE time > now() - 24h 
GROUP BY host
```

## Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Query performance metrics
- [ ] Write throughput
- [ ] Storage capacity
- [ ] Compression ratio
- [ ] Cache hit ratio
- [ ] Query response times

## Disaster Recovery
1. Backup Strategy
   - Regular snapshots
   - Continuous replication
   - Point-in-time recovery

2. Recovery Procedures
   - Data restoration process
   - Service failover
   - Consistency verification
