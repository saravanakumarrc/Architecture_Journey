## Core Analysis Methods

### 1. Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ATAM Process"
        P[Present Architecture] --> S[Identify Scenarios]
        S --> A[Analyze Approaches]
        A --> T[Trade-off Points]
        T --> R[Risks]
        R --> O[Outcomes]
        
        subgraph "Analysis"
            Q[Quality Attributes]
            B[Business Goals]
            C[Constraints]
        end
    end
```

## Quality Attributes Assessment

| Attribute | Metrics | Trade-offs | Priority |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| Performance | Response Time, Throughput | Cost, Complexity | High |
| Security | Vulnerabilities, Compliance | Usability, Cost | High |
| Maintainability | Change Cost, Tech Debt | Development Speed | Medium |
| Scalability | Load Handling, Cost Efficiency | Complexity, Cost | High |
| Reliability | Uptime, MTBF | Cost, Complexity | High |
| Usability | User Satisfaction, Adoption | Security, Cost | Medium |

Remember: Trade-off analysis is crucial for making informed architectural decisions. Always consider multiple factors, document your reasoning, and involve stakeholders in the decision-making process.
