# Multi-Cloud Strategy and Governance

## Overview
Multi-cloud strategy involves the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture. This document outlines key considerations, best practices, and governance frameworks for implementing a successful multi-cloud strategy.

## Key Components

### 1. Strategic Planning
- Business drivers for multi-cloud adoption
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Vendor selection criteria
- Exit strategy planning

### 2. Architecture Considerations
- Application portability
- Data sovereignty and compliance
- Network topology and connectivity
- Identity and access management across clouds
- Service mesh implementation
- API management strategy

### 3. Governance Framework
- Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)
- Policy management and enforcement
- Cost management and optimization
- Security and compliance standards
- Resource tagging and naming conventions
- Service catalog management

### 4. Operational Model
- Unified monitoring and observability
- Incident management across clouds
- DevOps practices and tools
- Automation and orchestration
- Disaster recovery and business continuity

## Best Practices

### 1. Standardization
