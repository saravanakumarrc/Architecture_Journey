# NoSQL Database Selection Criteria

## Database Types and Use Cases

### 1. Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB, Cosmos DB)
- Best suited for:
  - Semi-structured data
  - Content management systems
  - User profiles and preferences
  - Product catalogs
- Key characteristics:
  - Schema flexibility
  - Rich query capabilities
  - Document nesting
  - JSON/BSON format

### 2. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
- Best suited for:
  - Session management
  - Shopping carts
  - User preferences
  - Caching layers
- Key characteristics:
  - Simple data model
  - Very high performance
  - Limited query capabilities
  - In-memory options

### 3. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
- Best suited for:
  - Time-series data
  - Event logging
  - Weather data
  - IoT sensor data
- Key characteristics:
  - High write throughput
  - Column-based storage
  - Wide-column support
  - Excellent scalability

### 4. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
- Best suited for:
  - Social networks
  - Recommendation engines
  - Fraud detection
  - Knowledge graphs
- Key characteristics:
  - Relationship-focused
  - Complex query support
  - Native graph processing
  - Traversal optimization

## Selection Criteria Matrix

| Criteria | Document Store | Key-Value Store | Column-Family | Graph Database |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Query Complexity | High | Low | Medium | Very High |
| Write Performance | Medium | Very High | High | Medium |
| Read Performance | High | Very High | High | Medium |
| Scalability | Horizontal | Both | Horizontal | Vertical |
| Schema Flexibility | High | Very High | Medium | Medium |
| Data Size | TB-PB | GB-TB | PB+ | TB |
| Relationship Handling | Nested | None | Limited | Native |

## Decision Factors

### 1. Data Model Requirements
- Structure vs. flexibility needs
- Relationship complexity
- Query patterns
- Schema evolution

### 2. Performance Requirements
- Read vs. write ratio
- Latency expectations
- Throughput needs
- Concurrent users

### 3. Scalability Requirements
- Data volume growth
- User base growth
- Geographic distribution
- Partition tolerance

### 4. Consistency Requirements
- ACID needs
- CAP theorem priorities
- Eventual vs. strong consistency
- Transaction support

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Data Access Patterns
```javascript
// Document Store Example (MongoDB)
db.users.find({
  age: { $gt: 21 },
  interests: "technology"
}).sort({ lastLogin: -1 })

// Key-Value Store Example (Redis)
SET user:1001 { "name": "John", "session": "abc123" }
GET user:1001

// Graph Database Example (Cypher)
MATCH (user:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(follower:User)
WHERE user.name = "John"
RETURN follower.name
```

### 2. Deployment Models
- Self-hosted
  - Infrastructure requirements
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Control and customization
- Cloud-managed
  - Azure Cosmos DB
  - Amazon DynamoDB
  - Google Cloud Datastore

### 3. Cost Considerations
- Storage costs
- Transaction costs
- Network transfer
- Maintenance costs

## Cloud Provider Offerings

### Azure
- Cosmos DB (multi-model)
- Azure Cache for Redis
- Azure Table Storage

### AWS
- DynamoDB
- DocumentDB
- Amazon Neptune
- ElastiCache

### Google Cloud
- Cloud Datastore
- Cloud Bigtable
- Cloud Memorystore

## Migration Considerations

### 1. From Relational to NoSQL
- Schema transformation
- Data migration strategy
- Application refactoring
- Consistency trade-offs

### 2. Between NoSQL Types
- Data model mapping
- Performance implications
- Feature parity analysis
- Tooling requirements

## Common Anti-patterns

1. Using NoSQL just because it's "modern"
2. Ignoring consistency requirements
3. Not considering query patterns
4. Underestimating operational complexity
