```

### Compliance Requirements Matrix
| Regulation | Scope | Key Requirements | Penalties |
|------------|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| GDPR | EU Data Subjects | Data Protection, Consent, Rights | Up to 4% global revenue |
| CCPA | California Residents | Privacy Rights, Opt-out | $7,500 per violation |
| HIPAA | Healthcare Data | Security, Privacy, Access Control | Up to $1.5M per year |
| PCI DSS | Payment Card Data | Security Standards | Fines, Service Termination |

## Architectural Implications

### Security Requirements
```yaml
data_protection:
  encryption:
    - at_rest
    - in_transit
    - end_to_end
  access_control:
    - authentication
    - authorization
    - audit_logging
  data_governance:
    - classification
    - retention
    - disposal
```
