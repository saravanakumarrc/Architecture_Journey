## Core Integration Styles

### 1. API Integration

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "API Integration Patterns"
        API[API Gateway] --> S1[Service 1]
        API --> S2[Service 2]
        API --> S3[Service 3]
        
        subgraph "Components"
            R[Routing]
            T[Transform]
            V[Validate]
            C[Cache]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Event-Driven Integration

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Architecture"
        P1[Producer 1] --> B[Event Bus]
        P2[Producer 2] --> B
        B --> C1[Consumer 1]
        B --> C2[Consumer 2]
        
        subgraph "Event Flow"
            E[Event]
            F[Filter]
            T[Transform]
            D[Deliver]
        end
    end
```

## Common Antipatterns

### Integration Antipatterns to Avoid

1. **Direct Database Integration**
   - Tight coupling
   - Schema dependency
   - Versioning issues
   - Performance impact
   - Security risks

2. **Point-to-Point Integration**
   - Limited scalability
   - High maintenance
   - Complex dependencies
   - Difficult changes
   - Poor reusability

3. **Shared Code Libraries**
   - Version conflicts
   - Deployment coupling
   - Language dependency
   - Update complexity
   - Testing challenges

4. **Big Bang Integration**
   - High risk
   - Complex rollback
   - Long testing cycles
   - Resource intensive
   - Coordination overhead

## Trade-offs

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
- **Synchronous Integration**
  - Pros:
    * Immediate response
    * Simpler error handling
    * Better consistency
  - Cons:
    * Higher coupling
    * Less scalable
    * Availability impact

### Centralized vs. Distributed
- **Centralized Integration**
  - Pros:
    * Better control
    * Easier monitoring
    * Consistent policies
  - Cons:
    * Single point of failure
    * Performance bottleneck
    * Scale limitations

### Custom vs. Standard
- **Custom Integration**
  - Pros:
    * Perfect fit
    * Full control
    * Specific features
  - Cons:
    * Higher cost
    * More maintenance
    * Limited reuse

### Real-time vs. Batch
- **Real-time Integration**
  - Pros:
    * Immediate updates
    * Better user experience
    * Fresh data
  - Cons:
    * Higher complexity
    * More resources
    * Higher cost
