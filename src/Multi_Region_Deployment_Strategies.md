## Core Deployment Patterns

### 1. Active-Active Pattern

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Region 1 (Primary)"
        AF1[Azure Front Door] --> AKS1[AKS Cluster]
        AKS1 --> COSMOS1[Cosmos DB]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region 2 (Secondary)"
        AF1 --> AKS2[AKS Cluster]
        AKS2 --> COSMOS1
    end
    
    subgraph "Global Services"
        KV[Key Vault]
        AI[App Insights]
        LOG[Log Analytics]
    end
```

#### Key Characteristics
- Both regions actively serve traffic
- Automatic load balancing
- Higher availability
- Better resource utilization
- Higher operational cost

### 2. Active-Passive Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant TM as Traffic Manager
    participant P as Primary Region
    participant S as Secondary Region
    
    C->>TM: Request
    TM->>P: Route to Primary
    Note over P,S: Continuous Sync
    
    alt Primary Failure
        P->>TM: Health Check Fails
        TM->>S: Failover to Secondary
        S->>C: Handle Requests
    end
```

#### Key Characteristics
- Secondary region on standby
- Lower operational cost
- Simpler configuration
- Longer recovery time
- Resource underutilization

## Azure Implementation Strategy

### 1. Traffic Management

```typescript
// Example: Configuring Azure Front Door
const frontDoorProfile = {
    name: 'global-app-frontend',
    sku: {
        name: 'Premium_AzureFrontDoor'
    },
    endpoints: [{
        name: 'primary-endpoint',
        routingRules: [{
            patterns: ['/*'],
            acceptedProtocols: ['Http', 'Https'],
            routeConfiguration: {
                '@type': 'Microsoft.Azure.FrontDoor.Models.FrontDoorForwardingConfiguration',
                backendPool: {
                    name: 'multi-region-pool',
                    backends: [{
                        address: 'app-eastus.azurewebsites.net',
                        weight: 50,
                        priority: 1
                    }, {
                        address: 'app-westus.azurewebsites.net',
                        weight: 50,
                        priority: 1
                    }]
                }
            }
        }]
    }]
};
```

### 2. Data Replication

```typescript
// Example: Configuring Cosmos DB Multi-region
const cosmosDbAccount = {
    name: 'global-data-store',
    locations: [{
        locationName: 'East US',
        failoverPriority: 0,
        isZoneRedundant: true
    }, {
        locationName: 'West US',
        failoverPriority: 1,
        isZoneRedundant: true
    }],
    consistencyPolicy: {
        defaultConsistencyLevel: 'BoundedStaleness',
        maxStalenessPrefix: 100000,
        maxIntervalInSeconds: 300
    }
};
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Trade-offs |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Reserved Instances | Pre-purchase capacity | Less flexibility |
| Auto-scaling | Dynamic resource adjustment | Configuration complexity |
| Traffic Shifting | Route based on cost | Potential latency impact |
| Resource Right-sizing | Optimize resource allocation | Regular monitoring needed |

## Monitoring Framework

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Multi-region Monitoring"
        M[Metrics Collection] --> A[Analysis]
        A --> AL[Alerting]
        AL --> R[Response]
        
        subgraph "Metrics"
            LAT[Latency]
            COST[Cost]
            PERF[Performance]
            AVAIL[Availability]
        end
    end
```

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Recovery Strategies
- Active-Active failover
- Active-Passive failover
- Pilot light
- Data backup and restore

### 2. RTO/RPO Considerations
- Define acceptable data loss
- Set recovery time objectives
- Plan backup strategies
- Test recovery procedures

Remember:
- Start with clear business requirements
- Consider compliance needs
- Plan for failure
- Test regularly
- Monitor continuously
- Document everything
- Keep procedures updated
