## Debt Classification

### 1. Types of Technical Debt

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Debt Categories"
        C[Code Debt] --> CI[Implementation]
        C --> CD[Design]
        C --> CT[Test]
        
        A[Architecture Debt] --> AP[Patterns]
        A --> AS[Structure]
        A --> AI[Infrastructure]
        
        D[Documentation Debt] --> DT[Technical]
        D --> DA[Architecture]
        D --> DO[Operational]
    end
```

### 2. Impact Matrix
| Type | Business Impact | Maintenance Cost | Resolution Priority |
|------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Code | Medium | High | Medium |
| Architecture | High | Very High | High |
| Infrastructure | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Documentation | Low | Low | Low |

## Measurement Framework

### 1. Key Metrics

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Debt Metrics"
        CC[Cyclomatic Complexity]
        COV[Code Coverage]
        DUP[Duplication]
        COUP[Coupling]
        
        subgraph "Thresholds"
            T1[Warning]
            T2[Critical]
            T3[Blocking]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Scoring Model
| Metric | Weight | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Complexity | 30% | > 10 | > 20 |
| Coverage | 25% | < 80% | < 60% |
| Duplication | 25% | > 5% | > 10% |
| Violations | 20% | > 10 | > 20 |

## Remediation Strategy

### 1. Prioritization Framework

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Priority Matrix"
        direction TB
        
        subgraph "Impact"
            H[High]
            M[Medium]
            L[Low]
        end
        
        subgraph "Effort"
            E1[Easy]
            E2[Medium]
            E3[Hard]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Action Plan
1. **Quick Wins**
   - High impact
   - Low effort
   - Immediate ROI

2. **Strategic Initiatives**
   - High impact
   - High effort
   - Long-term value

3. **Gradual Improvements**
   - Low impact
   - Low effort
   - Continuous progress

## Prevention Framework

### 1. Quality Gates

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Quality Control"
        C[Commit] --> B[Build]
        B --> T[Test]
        T --> A[Analysis]
        A --> D[Deploy]
        
        subgraph "Gates"
            G1[Coverage]
            G2[Complexity]
            G3[Security]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Standards Checklist
- [ ] Code style guide
- [ ] Architecture principles
- [ ] Testing requirements
- [ ] Documentation standards
- [ ] Review process
- [ ] CI/CD practices

### 3. Review Process
1. **Code Review**
   - Style compliance
   - Best practices
   - Security checks
   - Performance review

2. **Architecture Review**
   - Pattern compliance
   - Design principles
   - Integration approach
   - Scalability review

## Monitoring and Reporting

### 1. Debt Dashboard

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monitoring Framework"
        M[Metrics] --> T[Trends]
        T --> A[Analysis]
        A --> R[Reporting]
        
        subgraph "Indicators"
            KPI[KPIs]
            ROI[ROI]
            RISK[Risk]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Progress Tracking
| Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Debt Ratio | 25% | 15% | ↓ |
| Coverage | 75% | 85% | ↑ |
| Complexity | Medium | Low | → |
| Violations | 45 | 20 | ↓ |

## Best Practices

- Regular assessment
- Clear ownership
- Dedicated budget
- Measurable goals
- Regular reviews

### 2. Team Culture
- Knowledge sharing
- Technical excellence
- Continuous learning
- Quality mindset
- Proactive approach

### 3. Communication
