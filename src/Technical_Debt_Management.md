## Technical Debt Matrix

| Type | Impact | Cost | Priority | Timeline |
|------|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Code Quality | High | Medium | P1 | Short-term |
| Architecture | Critical | High | P0 | Long-term |
| Testing | Medium | Medium | P2 | Mid-term |
| Documentation | Low | Low | P3 | Ongoing |
| Infrastructure | High | High | P1 | Mid-term |
| Security | Critical | High | P0 | Immediate |

## Debt Categories

1. **Code Debt**

   - Duplicate code
   - Missing tests
   - Complex logic
   - Poor performance

2. **Architecture Debt**
   - Rigid design
   - Poor scalability
   - High coupling
   - Low cohesion
   - Outdated patterns

3. **Infrastructure Debt**
   - Outdated systems
   - Manual processes
