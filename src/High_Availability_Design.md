## Availability Patterns

### 1. Redundancy Models

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Redundancy Patterns"
        AA[Active-Active] --> LB[Load Balancer]
        AP[Active-Passive] --> LB
        LB --> S1[System 1]
        LB --> S2[System 2]
        
        subgraph "Features"
            F[Failover]
            R[Replication]
            S[Synchronization]
        end
    end
```

#### Pattern Selection
| Pattern | Complexity | Cost | Recovery Time |
|---------|------------|------|---------------|
| Active-Active | High | High | Instant |
| Active-Passive | Medium | Medium | Minutes |
| N+1 | Medium | Medium-High | Seconds |
| Geographic | Very High | Very High | Variable |

### 2. Data Replication

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Replication Architecture"
        P[(Primary)] --> S1[(Secondary 1)]
        P --> S2[(Secondary 2)]
        P --> S3[(Secondary 3)]
        
        subgraph "Methods"
            SYNC[Synchronous]
            ASYNC[Asynchronous]
            SEMI[Semi-Sync]
        end
    end
```

#### Replication Strategies
1. **Synchronous**
   - Strong consistency
   - Higher latency
   - Lower throughput
   - Zero data loss

2. **Asynchronous**
   - Eventually consistent
   - Lower latency
   - Higher throughput
   - Possible data loss

3. **Semi-Synchronous**
   - Balanced approach
   - Configurable delay
   - Moderate performance
   - Minimal data loss

## Fault Tolerance

### 1. Isolation Patterns

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Fault Isolation"
        B[Bulkhead] --> P[Partition]
        P --> C[Circuit Breaker]
        C --> F[Fallback]
        
        subgraph "Strategies"
            RT[Retry]
            TO[Timeout]
            CB[Circuit Break]
        end
    end
```

#### Isolation Methods
| Method | Purpose | Impact | Recovery |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Bulkhead | Resource Isolation | Low | Immediate |
| Partition | Failure Containment | Medium | Quick |
| Circuit Break | Failure Prevention | High | Delayed |

### 2. Recovery Patterns

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Recovery Flow"
        D[Detection] --> I[Isolation]
        I --> R[Recovery]
        R --> V[Verification]
        
        subgraph "Actions"
            FAIL[Failover]
            REST[Restore]
            SYNC[Sync]
        end
    end
```

#### Recovery Components
1. **Detection**
   - Health checks
   - Monitoring
   - Alerting
   - Logging

2. **Isolation**
   - Circuit breaking

## Monitoring Framework

### 1. Health Monitoring

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monitoring System"
        H[Health Checks] --> M[Metrics]
        M --> A[Alerts]
        A --> R[Response]
        
        subgraph "Metrics"
            AV[Availability]
            LAT[Latency]
            ERR[Errors]
            SAT[Saturation]
        end
    end
```

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Recovery Strategy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "DR Framework"
        P[Prevention] --> D[Detection]
        D --> R[Response]
        R --> RE[Recovery]
        
        subgraph "Components"
            BCP[Business Continuity]
            RPO[Recovery Point]
            RTO[Recovery Time]
        end
    end
```
