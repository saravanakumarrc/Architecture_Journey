## Core Zero Trust Principles

### 1. Identity as the New Perimeter

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Identity-Centric Security"
        U[User] --> A[Authentication]
        A --> MFA[Multi-Factor Auth]
        MFA --> C[Context]
        C --> P[Policy Decision]
        
        subgraph "Context Evaluation"
            L[Location]
            D[Device Health]
            R[Risk Score]
            B[Behavior]
        end
    end
```

### 2. Micro-Segmentation

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Network Segmentation"
        APP[Application] --> S1[Segment 1]
        APP --> S2[Segment 2]
        APP --> S3[Segment 3]
        
        subgraph "Security Controls"
            P[Policies]
            M[Monitoring]
            E[Encryption]
        end
    end
```

### 3. Just-In-Time Access

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "JIT Access"
        R[Request] --> A[Approval]
        A --> P[Provisioning]
        P --> T[Time-Limited Access]
        T --> E[Expiration]
    end
```

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Security Monitoring"
        E[Events] --> C[Collection]
        C --> A[Analysis]
        A --> R[Response]
        
        subgraph "Response Actions"
            B[Block]
            RE[Revoke]
            AL[Alert]
            ES[Escalate]
        end
    end
```

## Trade-offs

### Security vs. Usability
- **High Security**
  - Pros: Better protection, reduced risk
  - Cons: More friction, reduced productivity

### Granular Control vs. Management Overhead
- **Fine-grained Control**
  - Pros: Precise access control, better security
  - Cons: Complex management, higher costs

### Real-time Monitoring vs. Performance
- **Continuous Monitoring**
  - Pros: Quick detection, better response
  - Cons: Resource intensive, potential latency

### Automation vs. Flexibility
- **High Automation**
  - Pros: Consistent enforcement, reduced human error
  - Cons: Less adaptability, potential false positives

## Best Practices

1. **Design Principles**
   - Verify explicitly
   - Use least privilege access
   - Assume breach
   - Verify end-to-end

2. **Security Controls**
   - Implement MFA everywhere
   - Enable continuous monitoring
   - Use automation
   - Regular auditing

3. **Operational Security**
   - Monitor continuously
   - Respond automatically
   - Update regularly
   - Train users

4. **Compliance**
   - Document controls
   - Regular assessments
   - Policy enforcement
   - Audit logging

Remember: Zero Trust is a journey, not a destination. Continuously evaluate and improve your security posture, and always verify every access request regardless of source.
