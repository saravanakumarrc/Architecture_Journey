**AI Defeats World's Top Mathematicians in Secret Test**
OpenAI's o4-mini reasoning model stunned 30 leading mathematicians at a secret Berkeley meeting by solving PhD-level problems in minutes that would take human experts weeks to complete. The AI demonstrated mathematical genius by independently mastering academic literature and solving complex number theory problems.

## Quick Facts üîç

‚Ä¢ **What**: Advanced AI that can reason through complex mathematical problems like a human expert
‚Ä¢ **Why it matters**: Shows AI is approaching human-level reasoning in specialized academic fields
‚Ä¢ **Cool factor**: The AI got 'cheeky' and told mathematicians 'No citation necessary because the mystery number was computed by me!'

## One-Minute Takeaway üí°

We're witnessing AI systems that don't just follow instructions but actually think through problems like graduate students. This breakthrough suggests AI is moving beyond simple pattern matching to genuine mathematical reasoning, potentially revolutionizing scientific research and problem-solving across many fields.
