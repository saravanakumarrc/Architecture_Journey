This document outlines trade-offs between various Azure services.  It's a living document and subject to change as Azure evolves.  "Trade-off" means understanding that choosing one service means potentially sacrificing benefits offered by another. Consider your specific requirements (scale, cost, latency, reliability, complexity) to guide your decisions.

## 1. Messaging: Event Grid vs. Service Bus

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Service Characteristics"
        SB[Service Bus] --> |High Reliability<br/>Complex Routing<br/>Higher Cost| M((Messaging<br/>Choice))
        EG[Event Grid] --> |Low Latency<br/>Simple Events<br/>Lower Cost| M
        QS[Queue Storage] --> |Basic Queuing<br/>Lowest Cost| M
    end
```

- **Event Grid:**
  - **Use Cases:** Reactive architectures, event-driven microservices, IoT scenarios requiring high throughput and low latency. Ideal for delivering events to multiple subscribers.
  - **Trade-offs:** Limited message ordering guarantees. Best suited for asynchronous, fire-and-forget scenarios. No guaranteed delivery.

- **Service Bus:**
  - **Use Cases:** Reliable asynchronous messaging, guaranteed delivery, complex routing, transaction support. Suitable for critical business processes.
  - **Trade-offs:** Higher latency compared to Event Grid. More expensive than Event Grid.

    quadrant-1 High Cost, High Complexity
    quadrant-2 Low Cost, High Complexity
    quadrant-3 Low Cost, Low Complexity
    quadrant-4 High Cost, Low Complexity
    Service Bus: [0.8, 0.9]
    Event Grid: [0.3, 0.4]
    Queue Storage: [0.2, 0.2]
```

## 2. Compute: Virtual Machines vs. Azure Functions vs. Azure Container Instances

```mermaid

        A[Compute Options] --> B[Virtual Machines]
        A --> C[Azure Functions]
        A --> D[Container Instances]
        
        B --> B1[Full Control<br/>Custom Software<br/>Legacy Apps]
        B --> B2[Higher Cost<br/>More Management<br/>Slower Scaling]
        
        C --> C1[Event-Driven<br/>Serverless<br/>Auto-Scaling]
        C --> C2[Time Limits<br/>Cold Starts<br/>Limited Runtime]
        
        D --> D1[Fast Startup<br/>Per-Second Billing<br/>Simple Deploy]
        D --> D2[Limited Orchestration<br/>No Auto-Scaling<br/>Regional Scope]
    end
```

- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
  - **Use Cases:** Full control over the operating system and environment. Legacy applications, custom configurations.
  - **Trade-offs:** Higher cost and management overhead. Slower scaling compared to serverless options.

- **Azure Functions:**
  - **Use Cases:** Event-driven, serverless compute for lightweight tasks. Ideal for microservices and short-lived processes.
  - **Trade-offs:** Limited execution time. Not suitable for long-running processes.

- **Azure Container Instances (ACI):**
  - **Use Cases:** Running containers without managing VMs. Suitable for burst workloads and isolated tasks.
  - **Trade-offs:** Limited orchestration capabilities compared to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
